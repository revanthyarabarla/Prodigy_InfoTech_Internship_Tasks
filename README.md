Task 1:
Encrypt and Decrypt Text using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm
This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, an ancient encryption technique. The script includes functions to both encrypt and decrypt text using a specified shift value.

How It Works
Encryption Function (encrypt):

Takes a text string and a shift value as inputs.
Iterates through each character in the text.
For alphabetic characters, it shifts their ASCII value by the specified shift, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
Returns the encrypted text.
Decryption Function (decrypt):

Utilizes the encrypt function with a negative shift to reverse the encryption.
Returns the decrypted text.
Main Function (main):

Prompts the user to input the text to be encrypted and the shift value.
Encrypts the input text using the specified shift value.
Decrypts the encrypted text to verify the process.
Prints the encrypted and decrypted texts.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Python installed on your system (Python 3.6+ isÂ recommended).

Task 2: Explanation

How It Works:-

*Encryption Function (encrypt_image):

1. Load Image: The function opens the image using PIL.Image.open.
2. Iterate through Pixels: It iterates through each pixel in the image.
3. Swap RGB Values: For each pixel, the RGB values are swapped (R becomes B, G becomes R, B becomes G).
4. Save Encrypted Image: The modified image is saved with _encrypted appended to the original file name.

*Decryption Function (decrypt_image):

1. Load Image: The function opens the encrypted image using PIL.Image.open.
2. Iterate through Pixels: It iterates through each pixel in the image.
3. Swap RGB Values: The RGB values are swapped back to their original positions (B becomes R, R becomes G, G becomes B).
4. Save Decrypted Image: The modified image is saved with _decrypted appended to the original file name.

*Main Function (main):

1. User Prompt: The user is prompted to choose between encryption and decryption.
2. Encrypt/Decrypt: Based on the user's choice, the respective function is called.
3. Repeat or Exit: The user can choose to continue with another image or exit.

How to Use:-

1. Ensure Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python and Pillow installed.
2. Run the Script: Execute the script in your Python environment.
3. Follow Prompts: Input the required information when prompted:
	- Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
	- Provide the image path.
	- The script will output the path to the encrypted/decrypted image.
4. Repeat or Exit: You can choose to process another image or exit the script.
